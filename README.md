## Hi there üëã

I am a backend engineer with a strong passion for building scalable and high-performance systems. After graduating with a degree in Software Engineering, I began working professionally on designing and implementing cloud-native architectures that are resilient, maintainable, and optimized for performance.

I take great pleasure in improving system performance and designing extensible architectures that can gracefully handle growing demands. I‚Äôm especially interested in distributed systems, microservice orchestration, and reactive programming models.

While my focus is on backend development, I‚Äôve also spent time exploring frontend technologies like React and React Native. This has helped me better understand the perspective of frontend teams and improved my ability to collaborate more effectively across the full stack.

Beyond writing efficient code, I enjoy translating business needs into clean, scalable system designs and believe that thoughtful architecture is the foundation of sustainable software. I‚Äôm always eager to explore new patterns, tools, and best practices that elevate both reliability and developer experience.

Currently, I continue to deepen my expertise in system design, DevOps culture, and cloud infrastructure, aiming to build systems that are not only functional but also elegant and future-proof.

## üöÄ Recent Projects

- **MCP-SSE-server-with-Java-demo**  
  Implemented a Java-based server to explore the inner workings of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on its use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) for bidirectional communication. The project helped me gain a deep understanding of message flows, prompt/tool invocation, and protocol-level behavior.

- **RAG + MCP Smart Home Architecture (conceptual)**  
  Currently designing a smart IoT home system architecture that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This conceptual project aims to explore how context-aware AI assistants can interface with real-world devices through structured protocols and reactive infrastructure.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Currently Studying

I am currently preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam to deepen my expertise in managing production-grade Kubernetes clusters. Alongside this, I‚Äôve been actively exploring emerging architectures such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on how these technologies can be integrated into scalable backend systems.
