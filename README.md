## Hi there üëã

I am a backend engineer with a strong passion for building scalable, high-performance systems. After graduating with a degree in Software Engineering, I began working professionally on designing and implementing cloud-native architectures that are resilient, maintainable, and optimized for growth.

I constantly think about how services can scale‚Äîboth in terms of traffic and evolving requirements‚Äîand find great satisfaction in creating systems that are not only efficient but also adaptable. My background in computer science has shaped my interest in concurrency, thread safety, and system-level stability, which I consider essential for building robust backend services.

While my main focus is backend development, I‚Äôve also explored frontend technologies like React and React Native. This experience has helped me better understand client-side perspectives and work more effectively across the full stack.

I actively apply patterns like microservice orchestration, reactive programming, and domain-driven design to deliver systems that are cleanly architected and future-proof. I‚Äôm always eager to refine my understanding of system design, DevOps culture, and distributed computing to solve real-world problems with clarity and scalability.

## üöÄ Recent Projects

- **MCP-SSE-server-with-Java-demo**  
  Implemented a Java-based server to explore the inner workings of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on its use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) for bidirectional communication. The project helped me gain a deep understanding of message flows, prompt/tool invocation, and protocol-level behavior.

- **RAG + MCP Smart Home Architecture (conceptual)**  
  Currently designing a smart IoT home system architecture that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This conceptual project aims to explore how context-aware AI assistants can interface with real-world devices through structured protocols and reactive infrastructure.  
  Sometimes ‚Äî okay, most of the time ‚Äî I lie in bed and imagine an AI assistant turning off the lights in my room for me.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Currently Studying

I am currently preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam to deepen my expertise in managing production-grade Kubernetes clusters. Alongside this, I‚Äôve been actively exploring emerging architectures such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on how these technologies can be integrated into scalable backend systems.
